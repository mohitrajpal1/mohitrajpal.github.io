        I'm about to graduate with my doctoral degree in Computer Science. During my studies I focused on scaling up decision-making under uncertainty. In my past life, I was a Software Engineer.

        I'm excited about Systems for Machine Learning, Machine Learning Systems, Bayesian Optimization, and Gaussian Processes.
